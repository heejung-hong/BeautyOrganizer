4. User stories
    1. I want to be able to see a list of makeup and skin care products I have, so that I don't have to look through all my cases to see what I have.  I can look at the list and quickly see what I have and grab it.

    2. I buy my skincare in bulk when it is on sale and it is annoying to look through my bins to inventory what I have for the next purchase.  It would be good to have a list with quantity visible so that I can easily add thing to the shopping cart.

    3.  I forget what skincare I have tried and it would be good to have a list of personal reviews so that I don't end up buying something I didn't like again.
