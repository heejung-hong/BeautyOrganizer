            <h2>About Beauty Organizer</h2>
            <p>
                This is an app to help organize your beauty products.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once you have created your inventory, you will no longer need to rummage around your stash to see what products you have.
                <br>
                <br>
                When it is time to reorder, you can have this list next to you while you place your order so you won't miss any items.
                <br>
                <br>
                With this list you won't repurchase the products you have tried and disliked, because your ratings and comments will be available for reference.
